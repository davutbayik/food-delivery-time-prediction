This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict food delivery times accurately. By analyzing various factors influencing delivery durations, it aims to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize logistics in the food delivery industry.

## üìä Project Overview

The repository implements and compares several regression models, including:

- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor

These models are trained and evaluated to determine the most effective approach for predicting delivery times.

## üß† Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generating relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implementing multiple regression algorithms.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using appropriate metrics.
